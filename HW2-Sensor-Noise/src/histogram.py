    plot the histogram (PDF) of pixel intensities for each sensitivity setting on the camera.
    
    Hint: How to make nice histograms ?!
    1. Use the plt.his function
    2. Use alpha around 0.8
    3. you can use the option ec="k"
    4. You can use density=True

    Takes the shape of an image and number of to be gridded points in X and Y direction 
    to sample equally spaced points on the 2D-grid
    
    We want to exclude points at the boundaries.
    
    E.g., if our image has 100 x 100 and we want to sample 3 x 4 points we would do the following 
    
    25 50 75 for the x-coordinate
    and
    20 40 60 80 for the y-coordinate
    
    Those 2 vectors then need to converted into 2 matrices for X and Y positions (use meshgrid)
    
    the following numpy functions can come in handy to develop this function:
    
    1. np.arange
    2. np.meshgrid
    3. np.round to cast to integer values 
    4. np.astype(np.uint16) as we want integer values for the coordinates

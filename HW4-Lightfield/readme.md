# Homework - All about lightfields

Homework has two parts, hence you also have to work through two different Jupyter Notebooks, called 
1. part1_lightfield
2. part2_synthethic

In the first part we'll introduce you to the idea of the lightfield. We'll visualize the light-field, will work on a interpolation method for light-field data and will work on a digital refocusing algorithm of light-field data. For this we're first refocusing 1D-signals and will then go over to 2D-signals (i.e. images)

The second part is about how you can capture an "approximation" of a light-field with a smartphone camera using the video stream. We provide you with pre-captured video that you'll use for a synthethic refocusing. Eventually, you'll have a pipeline where you can capture your own light-field data to digitally synthesize your images.

# Environment Set Up
The environment used in HW0 should work well. For your reference, we also provided that inside the HW4 root directory.

# Data Download
The data (credited by Prof. Oliver Cossairt at Northwestern University) used in this assignment is located in this Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V8D7rBMajj7DvrcDUyzfeekesjWHAeqe?usp=drive_link. Please download with your Princeton Drive account. The original lightfield data is from the Stanford lightfield archive can be found here: http://lightfield.stanford.edu/
